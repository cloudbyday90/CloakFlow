## Introduction

Cloakflow is a cutting-edge productivity application designed with privacy and security at its core. Leveraging the power of AI, Cloakflow aims to revolutionize how individuals manage their tasks, meetings, and data while ensuring the highest standards of privacy and compliance.

## Features

- **Task Extraction**: Automatically extract tasks from emails and meetings using AI-powered natural language processing.

- **Secure Data Storage**: Store all data locally on your device, ensuring end-to-end encryption and zero-knowledge architecture.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Receive personalized insights and suggestions to enhance productivity and workflow efficiency.

## Architecture

Cloakflow's architecture is built around a hybrid approach, combining the benefits of monorepo and multi-repo strategies. This allows for efficient code sharing, dependency management, and granular access control.

## Security and Compliance

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
- **Access Control**: Implement strict access controls, including two-factor authentication and role-based access control.
- **Compliance**: Designed to meet the requirements of GDPR, HIPAA, and FedRAMP, ensuring the highest standards of data protection.

## Development

Cloakflow is built using a combination of technologies, including:

- **Frontend**: Developed using modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and frameworks (React, Angular).
- **Backend**: Built using server-side languages (Node.js, Python) and frameworks (Express, Django).
- **AI/ML**: Utilizes machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for task extraction and meeting transcription.
